  <h1> This is my responsive CSS</h1>
  <p>We use @media rules to reduce the margin + padding, to reduce the wasted white space, on smaller devices. These are also often different depending if the user’s small device (e.g. a mobile phone) is in portrait or tablet mode (e.g. if it’s the width that is small, or the height that is small)</p>

  <p>This is my first responsive page using @meadia tag.</p>
